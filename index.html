          Obviously, the suicide rate og higher education student is lower than that of general population by every age group.
          But with the age increasing, the rates of both HE student and general population suicide appear an upward trend, which may be related to more stress in elder people's life.

                    Suicide rate of higher education students tends to be greater in senior age group.

            <p class="references">This was a coursework project for 7CCSMSDV – Simulation and Data Visualisation.
            The work was done by Yin Zhang, student number: 1929825.</p>
            <h4 class="references">Strengths of the implementation: </h4>
            <ol>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                Preprocess the raw data and convert it into .csv format, which is convenient for JavaScript to operate.
              </li>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                Interactive simulation is implemented to help describe the problem more vividly and enrich the elements of the web page.
              </li>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                Use D3.js to generate interactive charts including line chart, bar chart, stack barchart, group barchart as well as polar area chart
                to visualize the analytic results. The interactive function such as tooltip clearly represents the data in real time.
              </li>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                JS template is used to structure the layout and beautify the appearance of the project website.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4 class="references">Limitation of the implementation: </h4>
            <ol>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                More types of interactive charts such as multi-line chart and complex combined can be implemented to display the data more comprehensively.
              </li>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                Because the lack of skills to master D3, some dynamic effects didn't meet expectations. I will learn more to complete the project in the future.
              </li>
              <li class="suicidenum-header">
                Due to the limited dataset content, the analytic results are not forward-looking enough. Deeper research should be taken to improve the conclusion.
              </li>
